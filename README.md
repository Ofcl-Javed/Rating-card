## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Basic JavaScript
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com//) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned
I have practice SCSS with it and learn how to hide highlight color on button clicking.
```css
* {
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
}
```

### Continued development

I like to continue learn CSS for efficiency and compatiblity
